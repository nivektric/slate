Action type: `survey`

This action type represents a demographic survey that a user can complete in exchange for entries. Some questions are
dependent on the response to a previous question, and the logic for this will be server-side. Because of this, only
the next question will be present in the action. When responding to a particular question via the
`surveyQuestionResponse` API call, the next question, if any, will be returned in the response.

### Attributes

Name | Type |  Description
---- | ---- | -----------
current_survey_question | number | the question number (out of the total number of questions) that the next_question element represents, used to dipslay progress information to the user
total_survey_questions | number | the total number of survey questions in this survey, used to display progress information to the user
next_question | survey_question | the next question in the survey. See [survey questions](#survey-questions) for details on this structure. This value will be `null` if the user is finished with the survey.

            }
        ]
    }
}
```
